# p5-hosted-Example : Tree growth / Pizza Daisy

## [see It here](https://mikeymanoguerra.github.io/p5-hosted-example/)

This was a project to show examples of made from scratch p5 art. Made for students in SMASH Wharton's Computer Science II.

This git project was pushed, hosted, and edited to have multiple pages and different styles all via the github web editor, something I have never done outside of this project. 

This is notable because these projects were done as examples for a one month intro to JS class that I taught. Learning git was outside the scope of the class, so I was thankful to discover you did not need the command line to push a project and  deploy it to github pages.
